# PyBay Sponsored Talk Policy

The policy contains two parts:
* Guidelines for the PyBay committee about organizing the talks
* Guidelines for sponsors when submitting and giving the talks

## PyBay policy

* Talks must be clearly labeled as "Sponsored", both in the schedule and physically during the conference.
* Sponsored talks should be given at the same time as regular talks: there cannot be a time with only sponsored talks.
  (with some margin for error if break times do not align between regular talks and sponsored talks)
* If at all possible, sponsored talks should be in one "time block": if we want to use the same space for both
  sponsored and non-sponsored talks, we should consolidate all the sponsored talks into one time block,
  to minimize confusion and the need to post and remove physical signs.
* Talks submitted as "sponsored talks" must be submitted via the sponsorship channels
  (the same way sponsors would send the logo details).
  Talks submitted via the regular channels should be evaluated without regards to whether the person
  submitting them is affiliated with a sponsor.
* If a sponsored talk violates the talk policy below,
  prompt feedback should be given to the sponsor with a best effort attempt of guidance for
  how the talk can be modified to comply with the policy.

## Talk policy

* Talks must be relevant to Python developers. This does not mean they have to be about Python:
  for example, "Best Practices for Metrics" is relevant to many developers.
* Talks are allowed to mention non-open-source products, 
  but the value of the talk to developers
  cannot solely depend on such products.
  There must be some useful take-away for people who will
  use only
  open source products
  (regardless of who makes them).
  For example, a company building a SaaS for a database cannot give a talk
  about how to use the SaaS,
  but it can give a talk about "SQL Tips" and show examples using the
  SaaS,
  as long as the same tips will work on SQLite or PostgreSQL.
* Exception:
  If a talk only has value to people who use something non-open-source,
  this is acceptable under two conditions,
  which must *both* be satisfied:
  * The sponsor is not the company making the non-open source product.
  * The product is expected to be in wide use in the Python developer community.
  
An example for the exception is a talk about how to install
Python
on a
macOS laptop,
given by a sponsor other than Apple.
This satisfies the conditions:
* The sponsor is not making the non-open-source product.
* macOS laptops are in wide use in the Python developer community.
